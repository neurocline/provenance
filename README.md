provenance
=========================

Provenance tracks the origin and use of lines of source code. There is no
single source of truth, instead provenance assumes that any project fed
into it is another hint, strong or not, for the origin for that code.


RUNNING PROVENANCE
-----------------

TBD


SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
-----------------

The current system is a prototype in python.

For now, Provenance works at the level of lines of code. One future direction
is to use the results of parsing and then track at multiple levels of abstraction.
